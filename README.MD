# Food Delivery Time Prediction

## Introduction
This project focuses on building a model to accurately predict delivery times for a food delivery service. The aim is to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency by providing precise delivery estimates.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Dataset files for the project.
- `models/`: Spark ML models used and trained in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter or Zeppelin notebooks for experimentation and learning.
- `output/`: Output directory for storing results such as CSV files, text files, and images from the pipeline.
- `scripts/`: Contains shell (`.sh`) and Python (`.py`) scripts for running the data pipeline.
- `sql/`: SQL and Hive query language (`.sql` and `.hql`) files for database operations.

## Files
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies required for the project.
- `main.sh`: Main script that executes the full pipeline, with outputs stored in the `output/` folder. This script is critical for assessment and should not be modified.

## Data Pipeline Stages
1. **Data Collection and Ingestion**
2. **Data Preparation and Storage**
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
4. **Data Presentation**

## Conclusion
This project leverages machine learning to predict food delivery times effectively, aiming to improve service quality in the food delivery industry.
